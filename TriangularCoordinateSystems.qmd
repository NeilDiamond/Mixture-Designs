title: "Triangular Coordinate Systems"

Consider a mixture with just two constituents \'x1\' and \'x2\'. These constituents can be mixed in any proportion from pure \'x1\' to pure \'x2\'.

The mixture can be represented by a straight line where any possible composition is a point on the line:

Now consider a mixture with three constituents \'x1\', \'x2\' and \'x3\'. This time the diagram is a little more complicated but it can be represented by a triangle using a triangular coordinate system:

The first image shows only x1. The x1 vertex represents pure x1. The proportion of x1 reduces to zero at the opposite side of the triangle.

It is harder to illustrate the idea graphically for more than three components but the three component model allows explanation of all the concepts. It will make life easier if I assume a three mixture designs in the explanations.
