For example if there are three components x1, x2 and x3 the mix might be:\nMixtures are common and finding the best mix is often important. The types of experiments discussed previously in this course can be used but don't work particularly well. The forms of regression equations that are used do not model the response surfaces of most mixtures at all well. The positions of the design points in a conventional experimental array are not efficient in revealing the properties of the mixture.\nIt is better to use a specialized mixture design. In this section I will avoid the mathematics of mixture designs but concentrate on how to analyze mixtures using Minitab.\nprevious: Objectives\nnext: Triangular Coordinate Systems"

    "text": "Most mixtures are only viable within a reasonably small range of proportions. It is a waste of time to place points on the side of a triangle, because they do not contain all the components.\nThe L-Simplex designs are similar to simplex designs, except that it uses a triangle with sides parallel to, but inside the triangle of the Simplex design.\nYou may come across the term ‘pseudocomponents’. L-Simplex designs are analyzed using pseudocomponents. Pseudocomponents are defined to run from 0 to 1 using the interior triangle. Thus if x1 has an allowable range running from 0.2 to 0.8 its pseudocomponent has a proportion of 0 when x1 equals 0.2 and 1 when x1 = 0.8.\nThe L-Simplex will not always do the job. Concrete is made from a mix of cement powder, water and aggregate. The approximate proportions to give a satisfactory mix are known within fairly tight limits. We want to explore within this range:"
